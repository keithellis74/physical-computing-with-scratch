There are a couple of versions of scratch installed on the Raspberry Pi by default, Scratch and Scratch 2.  This learning guide uses Scratch 2.
The versions of Scratch included with the Raspberry Pi have a number of unique features; one of the most useful is its ability to communicate with the GPIO pins (General Purpose Input Output). These pins allow you to connect your Raspberry Pi to a range of devices, from lights and motors to buttons and sensors. The original Raspberry Pi had a 26-pin header and newer models (B+, Pi 2, Pi 3, etc) have a 40-pin header, but this workshop will work with any model.
